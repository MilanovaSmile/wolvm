# wolvm
Wake-on-Lan for virtual machines. The application listens to network interfaces waiting for a "magic packet". When a packet is received, a search is performed for a virtual machine whose MAC address of the network interface matches the received MAC address. The search for a virtual machine is performed via virsh.
